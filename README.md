`My Superpower - Your code starts working when you show me the problem and I merely stare at it!`

### 👋 Hi, I'm Saurabh Prasad. Your Friendly Neighborhood Tech Guy !

I’m a Computer Science grad at the University of Florida. Big believer in hard work and a passionate software engineer with 3 years of professional experience. I started my career with Barclays where I worked on building event-driven, microservices for Fraud Detection and Identity Verification. My next challenge took me Skeps, a blockchain-based startup in consumer lending space. I created Rest APIs in Java and node.js and executed Quorum smart contracts. Through multi-threading, remodeling DB schemas, and indexing, I speeded existing APIs by 300% leading to ten folds increase in daily loan processing capacity. These experiences imparted me a strong foundation in design principles, OOPs concepts, and clean code practices. 

This summer I did two internships at ClaimFound and IHS Markit broadening my understanding of python, docker and CI/CD. I keep myself active with research work (published 2 papers) and side projects in deep learning, NLP, game development, etc.
